# ADR-001: Core Architecture and Design Patterns

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Story Curator needs a robust, maintainable, and extensible architecture that supports audio processing, text analysis, and future media types while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

## Decision
We will implement a clean architecture with the following key patterns:

1. **Layer Separation**
   - Core domain logic independent of frameworks
   - Interfaces for all external dependencies
   - Clear separation between business rules and delivery mechanisms

2. **Module Organization**
```
media_analyzer/
├── core/          # Core business logic and interfaces
├── processors/    # Media processing implementations
├── models/        # Domain models and data structures
├── utils/         # Shared utilities
└── cli/          # Command-line interface
```

3. **Design Patterns**
   - Strategy Pattern for interchangeable processing algorithms
   - Factory Pattern for processor creation
   - Observer Pattern for progress monitoring
   - Command Pattern for CLI operations

4. **Dependency Rules**
   - Inner layers contain business rules
   - Outer layers contain implementation details
   - Dependencies point inward
   - No circular dependencies

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing through modularity
- Simplified maintenance
- Flexible for future extensions
- Consistent structure across modules

### Negative
- More initial setup required
- More boilerplate code
- Learning curve for new developers

## Implementation Notes

1. **Core Components**
   ```python
   class Analyzer(ABC):
       """Abstract base for media analyzers."""
       @abstractmethod
       def process_file(self, file_path: str, options: dict) -> AnalysisResult:
           pass
   ```

2. **Factory Pattern**
   ```python
   class ProcessorFactory:
       @staticmethod
       def create_processor(media_type: str) -> MediaProcessor:
           if media_type == "audio":
               return AudioProcessor()
           # ... other processor types
   ```

3. **Strategy Pattern**
   ```python
   class TextExtractionStrategy(ABC):
       @abstractmethod
       def extract_text(self, media_data: bytes) -> str:
           pass
   ```
