# ADR-00X: Mobile Security Hardening

## Status
**Accepted** | 2024-01-15

> **Branding note:** User-facing product = **Lythaus**; internal/infra = **Asora**. See [branding guide](../branding/lythaus-transition.md).

## Context

The Lythaus mobile application (internally codenamed Asora) handles sensitive user data including posts, reactions, and personally identifiable information. As per OWASP Mobile Top 10, mobile apps face unique security challenges:

- **M3: Insecure Communication** - Man-in-the-middle attacks, certificate authority compromises
- **M8: Security Misconfiguration** - Rooted/jailbroken devices with reduced security controls
- **M10: Insufficient Cryptography** - Weak TLS configurations, missing certificate validation

Without proper mobile-specific hardening, users are exposed to:
1. Credential theft via MITM attacks
2. Automated abuse from compromised devices
3. Unauthorized data access from malicious root apps

## Decision

Implement comprehensive mobile security hardening with:

1. **TLS Certificate Pinning** (SPKI-based)
   - SHA-256 hash validation of server public keys
   - Multi-pin support for smooth rotation
   - Environment-specific strict/warn-only modes

2. **Device Integrity Detection**
   - Root/jailbreak detection via `flutter_jailbreak_detection`
   - Emulator detection
   - Debug build identification

3. **Risk-Based Policy Enforcement**
   - Block high-risk operations (sign-in, post creation, DSR) on compromised devices in production
   - Allow low-risk operations (feed reading) with warnings
   - Warn-only mode for development/staging

4. **Security Overrides for QA/Support**
   - Time-limited break-glass mechanism
   - Audit trail with reason and ticket references
   - Cannot be enabled in release builds

5. **Security Telemetry**
   - Structured logging of all security events
   - No PII in telemetry (no user IDs, emails, device identifiers)
   - Monitoring hooks for alerting

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Reduces attack surface**: Pinning prevents MITM, integrity checks block automated abuse
- **Compliance alignment**: Meets OWASP Mobile Top 10 recommendations
- **User trust**: Demonstrates commitment to security, protects user data
- **Operational visibility**: Telemetry enables incident detection and response
- **Graceful degradation**: Risk-based policies balance security and usability

### Negative

- **Development complexity**: Adds configuration management, testing overhead
- **Certificate rotation risk**: Incorrect pin rotation can lock out users
- **False positive support**: Some legitimate users on modified devices may be blocked
- **Performance impact**: Minimal (<500ms per integrity check, cached for 1 hour)

### Mitigations

- **Pin rotation strategy**: Dual pinning with phased rollout
- **QA override mechanism**: Allows testing on modified devices
- **Support override**: Emergency break-glass for legitimate cases
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Runbooks, QA checklists, troubleshooting guides
- **Telemetry monitoring**: Alerting on high block rates (potential false positives)

## Implementation

### Components

1. **Environment Configuration** (`lib/core/config/environment_config.dart`)
   - Dev/staging/prod profiles with security settings
   - TlsPinConfig, MobileSecurityConfig classes

2. **TLS Pinning** (`lib/core/security/tls_pinning.dart`)
   - TlsPinningValidator with SPKI hash extraction
   - PinnedHttpClient wrapper for Dio integration

3. **Device Security** (`lib/core/security/device_security_service.dart`)
   - DeviceSecurityState model
   - DeviceSecurityServiceImpl with caching

4. **Integrity Guard** (`lib/core/security/device_integrity_guard.dart`)
   - Use-case based policy evaluation
   - DeviceIntegrityDecision (allow/warn/block)

5. **Security Overrides** (`lib/core/security/security_overrides.dart`)
   - SecurityOverrideConfig with expiry
   - Break-glass for QA/support

6. **Telemetry** (`lib/core/security/security_telemetry.dart`)
   - SecurityEvent model
   - Structured logging without PII

7. **Network Integration** (`lib/core/network/dio_client.dart`)
   - Dio adapter with pinned HTTP client
   - Device integrity interceptor

8. **UI Helpers** (`lib/core/security/device_integrity_guard.dart`)
   - `runWithDeviceGuard()` for critical flows
   - Blocking dialogs and warning snackbars

### Testing

- **Unit tests**: 80%+ coverage for security logic (pinning, integrity, guard, overrides)
- **Integration tests**: Full flows with pinned connections, blocked operations
- **Manual QA**: Platform-specific testing per QA checklist
- **Monitoring**: Telemetry dashboards for security metrics

### Documentation

- `docs/tls-pinning.md` - Pin extraction and rotation
- `docs/mobile-security-policies.md` - Policy matrix and enforcement logic
- `docs/mobile-security-qa-checklist.md` - Testing procedures
- `docs/runbooks/tls-pinning-rotation.md` - Operational procedures
- `docs/runbooks/handle-rooted-device-complaints.md` - Support guidance

### Tooling

- `tools/extract_spki.dart` - SPKI extraction from live servers/PEM files
- OpenSSL commands for production pin extraction

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. No Mobile Security Hardening (Status Quo)
**Rejected**: Unacceptable risk for user data, non-compliance with OWASP guidelines.

### 2. Certificate Pinning Only (No Device Integrity)
**Rejected**: Doesn't address rooted device abuse vector.

### 3. Full Certificate Pinning (Not SPKI)
**Rejected**: Fragile to certificate renewal, requires app updates for every cert rotation.

### 4. Block All Rooted Devices (No Risk-Based Policies)
**Rejected**: Too aggressive, alienates legitimate users (e.g., enthusiasts, developers).

### 5. Third-Party Mobile Security SDK
**Considered**: SafetyNet/Play Integrity (Android), DeviceCheck (iOS)  
**Decision**: Start with open-source detection, integrate platform APIs in future iteration.

## Review Schedule

- **Next review**: Before each major release (quarterly)
- **Triggers for early review**:
  - Security incident involving mobile app
  - Platform API changes (iOS/Android OS updates)
  - New attack vectors identified
  - Block rate >10% (potential false positives)
