## Context and Problem Statement

In a peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging system, messages are exchanged directly between users without a centralized server. 
Such systems often require efficient mechanisms to store and manage messages due to the decentralized nature of the 
network and the high volume of message traffic. To ensure smooth operation, very often a cache is used to temporarily 
store messages, providing quick access to recently used messages and improving overall performance.

In a P2P messaging system, efficiently managing the message cache is critical for maintaining performance and user 
experience. The cache has limited capacity, and it's important to decide which messages to retain and which to evict. 
This decision is influenced by the frequency and recency of message access.

### Why Move Repeated Messages To The Front?

Maintain Relevance and Quick Access:

  - Messages that are accessed repeatedly are likely to be important and relevant to ongoing user interactions. 
Moving these messages to the front of the cache ensures that they remain quickly accessible.

Optimize Cache Usage:

  - By prioritizing recently used messages, the cache can more effectively use its limited capacity. Repeatedly accessed 
messages are kept in the cache, while less frequently accessed messages are evicted.


Reduce Latency:

### Consequences of Not Moving Repeated Messages to the Front
Increased Latency and Reduced Performance:

  - If repeated messages are not moved to the front, they might be evicted from the cache despite being frequently accessed. 
This results in increased latency as the system needs to retrieve these messages from a slower storage layer.
  - The cache might retain less relevant messages while evicting important ones. This inefficiency can lead to a lower 
cache hit rate, making the cache less effective.

Poor User Experience:

  - Users expect quick access to recent messages, especially in a messaging application. If the system fails to provide 
this due to poor cache management, user satisfaction can decline.

## Summary
In a P2P messaging system, moving repeated messages to the front is essential for maintaining efficient cache utilization, 
reducing latency, and ensuring a positive user experience. Failing to do so can lead to increased latency, inefficient 
cache use, and a degraded user experience, ultimately affecting the system's performance and scalability.
