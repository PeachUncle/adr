# ADR 001: Provider Pattern for State Management

**Status:** ✅ Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team

---

## Context

Flutter offers multiple state management solutions:

- **Provider** - Google's recommended solution, built on InheritedWidget
- **Riverpod** - Modern Provider alternative with compile-time safety
- **Bloc** - Event-driven architecture with streams
- **GetX** - All-in-one solution with DI, routing, state
- **MobX** - Reactive programming with observables

For TrossApp's frontend, we needed a state management solution that:

1. Is simple and maintainable (KISS principle)
2. Has excellent Flutter integration
3. Is well-documented and widely adopted
4. Supports our auth + app state needs
5. Doesn't require heavy boilerplate

---

## Decision

We chose **Provider** for the following reasons:

### ✅ Simplicity & KISS Compliance

```dart
class AuthProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  bool _isAuthenticated = false;

  Future<void> login() async {
    // Simple, readable logic
    _isAuthenticated = true;
    notifyListeners(); // Explicit state updates
  }
}
```

- Explicit state changes with `notifyListeners()`
- No code generation required
- Easy to debug and trace

### ✅ Google-Recommended

- Official Flutter team recommendation
- Part of `flutter/packages` ecosystem
- Extensive documentation and examples

### ✅ Perfect Fit for Our Needs

- **2 providers:** `AuthProvider`, `AppProvider`
- Simple state (auth status, user data, app config)
- No complex reactive graphs needed

### ✅ Wide Adoption

- Large community support
- Proven in production at scale
- Easy to hire developers familiar with it

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Riverpod

- **Pros:** Compile-time safety, no BuildContext
- **Cons:** Newer, less examples, more complex API
- **Decision:** Overkill for our simple needs

### Bloc

- **Pros:** Structured event/state pattern, testable
- **Cons:** Heavy boilerplate, streams add complexity
- **Decision:** Too much ceremony for auth + app state

### GetX

- **Pros:** Batteries included (routing, DI, state)
- **Cons:** Magic, non-standard patterns, tight coupling
- **Decision:** Violates KISS, hides too much

### MobX

- **Pros:** Reactive programming, minimal boilerplate
- **Cons:** Requires code generation, unfamiliar to team
- **Decision:** Code gen adds build complexity

---

## Consequences

### Positive ✅

- **Readable Code:** State changes are explicit and traceable
- **Fast Onboarding:** New developers learn Provider quickly
- **Minimal Boilerplate:** 2 providers, ~500 lines total
- **Excellent Testing:** Easy to mock and test providers
- **Flutter Integration:** Works seamlessly with widgets

### Negative ⚠️

- **Manual Optimization:** Need to use `Consumer` carefully to avoid rebuilds
- **No Compile-Time Safety:** Typos in provider access fail at runtime
- **Global State:** Easy to abuse with too many providers

### Mitigations 🛡️

- Kept provider count low (2 total)
- Used `select()` and `Consumer` for targeted rebuilds
- Comprehensive tests (100% provider coverage)
- Code reviews enforce minimal provider usage

---

## Validation

**Test Results:**

- ✅ 100% test coverage on both providers
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite including provider tests
- ✅ E2E tests validate state transitions
- ✅ Concurrent operation tests validate high-load scenarios

**Production Performance:**

- AuthProvider: <50ms average state update
- AppProvider: Minimal rerenders with `select()`
- Zero memory leaks in testing
