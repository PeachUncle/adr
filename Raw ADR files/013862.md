# 11. Invalidate Redis flag caches via pub/sub

Date: 2025-10-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Flag evaluation must stay fast while reflecting project changes within seconds. Redis already powers cached flag snapshots and evaluation payloads (ADR 8), but we lacked a documented plan for expiring or refreshing those entries when flags mutate. Multiple API workers and background jobs will run concurrently, so the invalidation mechanism needs to notify every instance without relying on shared in-memory state.

## Decision

-   Model cache entries with deterministic keys and shared TTLs. Snapshots live at `flag:snapshot:{project}:{environment}` and user-specific evaluations at `flag:evaluation:{project}:{environment}:{flag}:{signature}:{hash}`. All structures are JSON-encoded strings with a default TTL of five minutes (300 seconds).
-   Maintain a lightweight index per environment at `flag:evaluation:index:{project}:{environment}` to delete cached evaluations without scanning Redis when mutations occur. The index expires alongside the evaluation entries.
-   When flags, projects, or environments change, the domain layer publishes an event to the Redis channel `phlag.flags.invalidated` containing the affected project and environment identifiers. Listeners delete matching keys (`DEL`) and optionally trigger eager rebuilds.
-   The `cache:warm {project} {env}` CLI command subscribes to the same message bus when running in daemon mode. It precomputes snapshots after deploys, replays historical evaluations to seed the user-scoped cache entries, and offers operators a manual way to refresh caches without restarting services.
-   HTTP workers subscribe to the invalidation channel during boot. On receipt, they evict in-memory copies and allow the next request to repopulate Redis, ensuring horizontally scaled replicas stay in sync.

### Key schema and payloads

-   Segment encoding: all `{project}`, `{environment}`, `{flag}`, and `{signature}` segments are lower-cased and sanitised by replacing colons, braces, and whitespace with underscores. This keeps keys human-readable while avoiding Redis hash-slot conflicts.

| Key | Purpose | TTL (default / override) | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `flag:snapshot:{project}:{environment}` | Cached snapshot payload produced by `FlagSnapshotFactory::make()`; consumed by evaluators and warmers. | `300s` / `FLAG_CACHE_SNAPSHOT_TTL` (`config('flag_cache.snapshot_ttl')`) | `flag:snapshot:billing:production` |
| `flag:evaluation:{project}:{environment}:{flag}:{signature}:{hash}` | Cached result of an individual flag evaluation, keyed by the flag signature and caller context hash. | `300s` / `FLAG_CACHE_EVALUATION_TTL` (`config('flag_cache.evaluation_ttl')`) | `flag:evaluation:billing:production:new_banner:9f82...:4a6c...` |
| `flag:evaluation:index:{project}:{environment}` | Redis set of evaluation keys for the environment, used to bulk delete entries after mutations. | Matches evaluation TTL; refreshed on each write. | `flag:evaluation:index:billing:production` |

Snapshot entries include project metadata, environment metadata, an array of flag definitions, and a `generated_at` timestamp. Snapshot warmers refresh hot environments after deploys; cold keys expire naturally.

Evaluation entries store JSON with the following schema:

```json
{
    "variant": "string-or-null",
    "reason": "string",
    "rollout": 100,
    "payload": {
        "example": "contextual-data"
    },
    "bucket": 42
}
```

-   `{signature}` is a SHA-1 of the canonicalised flag definition (enabled state, variants, rules, `updated_at`). Any mutation to the flag regenerates this signature so previous cache entries miss naturally.
-   `{hash}` is a SHA-1 of the evaluation context: the user identifier (or empty string) plus sorted attribute keys and values. Attribute arrays are sorted to guarantee stable hashes regardless of input order.
-   Optional `payload` and `bucket` keys mirror the runtime `EvaluationResult` contract. Absent keys are omitted from the JSON payload to keep entries compact.

Evaluation indices expire alongside their member evaluations. Writers refresh the index TTL on every `sadd` to avoid stranding keys, and readers clean up empty or expired indices before returning fallback results.

Invalidation payloads are JSON objects containing `project` and `environment`. Listeners use these identifiers to drop both the snapshot key and the evaluation index:

```json
{"project":"billing","environment":"production"}
```

### TTL strategy

-   Five-minute TTLs balance freshness with reduced load on Postgres. Operators can shorten or extend TTLs via the `FLAG_CACHE_SNAPSHOT_TTL` and `FLAG_CACHE_EVALUATION_TTL` environment variables if high churn or read-heavy workloads demand it.
-   Hot environments should be warmed immediately after deploys with `cache:warm` to avoid cold-start latency. Cold environments naturally expire and are generated lazily on demand.
-   Evaluation caches couple TTL with pub/sub invalidations so missed events have a bounded blast radius. Audit metrics should monitor key age and hit rates to refine TTL values over time.
-   Operators can temporarily lower TTLs during large rollouts or flag migrations to guarantee faster recovery while leaving the invalidation pipeline intact. Restoring the default keeps Redis churn manageable once the rollout stabilises.

### Operational toggles

-   Local troubleshooting can disable snapshot or evaluation caching entirely by setting `FLAG_CACHE_SNAPSHOTS_ENABLED=false` or `FLAG_CACHE_EVALUATIONS_ENABLED=false`. When disabled the application skips reads/writes but still supports invalidation so other workers keep behaving correctly.

## Consequences

Positive

-   A single pub/sub channel keeps cache coherence across the Laravel Zero CLI, future HTTP bridge, and any background workers.
-   Deterministic key names simplify observability: operators can inspect or purge entries with standard Redis tooling.
-   Time-bound TTLs provide an automatic safety net if an invalidation is missed, limiting staleness to minutes.

Negative

-   Workers must maintain a long-lived Redis subscription; reconnect logic and back-off handling add operational complexity.
-   Cache warmers and consumers need to respect payload schemas. Future schema changes require coordinating deploys to avoid deleting the wrong keys.
-   Pub/sub is best-effort; we may still need explicit `cache:warm` runs after large migrations or Redis restarts to recover quickly.
