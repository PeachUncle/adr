# 0004. Use of .NET Aspire for Development Orchestration

Date: 2025-11-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

### Question

How should we orchestrate the multiple components of this application during development?

### Background

Frontend and backend will be packaged, deployed, hosted, and executed as separate units, so orchestration between them is necessary.

### Previous Pain Points

In past projects, I've found other orchestration methods cumbersome:

* **Docker Compose** - Requires maintaining separate Dockerfiles and compose configurations, slower feedback loop, complexity in debugging across containers
* **Separate dev servers** - Running frontend dev server independently and proxying backend API calls is error-prone, requires manual coordination, inconsistent environment setup

### Requirements

Our development orchestration needs to:
- Run both .NET backend and Node.js frontend concurrently
- Provide easy service discovery between components
- Enable debugging across distributed components
- Support rapid iteration with hot reload
- Provide observability (logs, traces, metrics) during development

## Decision

We will use **.NET Aspire** for development orchestration. It is well-suited to managing the complexities of distributed applications and provides excellent developer experience for .NET-centric polyglot applications.

### Scope Limitation

**Important:** This decision applies primarily to **development orchestration**, with limited adoption in the container environment for **observability**.

#### Container Environment Adoption

We have successfully added Aspire **for observability only** to the container environment, which has greatly improved our container environment observability through the Aspire Dashboard. This provides unified logs, traces, and metrics aggregation without using Aspire for orchestration in that environment.

#### Production Deployment

For production, we run in:
- Frontend: Azure Static Web App
- Backend: Azure App Service

This separation allows us to:
- Reduce costs of running compute for the front-end container
- Optimize each component for its deployment target
- Keep deployment options flexible

## Consequences

### What Becomes Easier

1. **Unified Development Experience**
   - Single command (`dotnet run` from AppHost) starts entire application stack
   - Aspire Dashboard provides unified view of all services, logs, and telemetry
   - Consistent environment setup across team members

2. **Service Discovery**
   - Automatic service-to-service communication without hardcoded URLs
   - Frontend automatically knows backend URL in development
   - No need for manual proxy configuration

3. **Observability**
   - Built-in structured logging aggregation
   - Distributed tracing across frontend/backend boundaries
   - Health checks and metrics out of the box
   - OpenTelemetry integration

4. **Resource Management**
   - Can easily add dependencies (Redis, SQL Server, etc.) later
   - Resource lifecycle managed automatically
   - Clean shutdown of all services

5. **Debugging**
   - Attach debuggers to any service from Visual Studio/VS Code
   - Clear visualization of request flows
   - Easy access to logs and traces for troubleshooting

6. **Onboarding**
   - New developers can start the entire stack with minimal setup
   - Self-documenting through AppHost configuration
   - Reduces "works on my machine" issues

### What Becomes More Difficult

1. **Learning Curve**
   - Future contributors needs to understand Aspire concepts and dashboard
   - Additional mental model beyond just "run backend, run frontend"

2. **Tooling Requirements**
   - Requires .NET 8+ SDK even for developers primarily working on frontend
   - Visual Studio 2022 17.9+ or VS Code with C# Dev Kit recommended

3. **Configuration Complexity**
   - AppHost project adds another layer to maintain
   - Need to keep Aspire orchestration in sync with actual deployment architecture

4. **Deployment Divergence**
   - Development environment differs from production
   - Must ensure features work in both Aspire-orchestrated and standalone modes
   - Testing deployment configuration requires separate process

5. **Limited to .NET Ecosystem**
   - If we later add non-.NET services, Aspire support may be limited
   - Heavier dependency on Microsoft tooling

### Migration Path

If we decide to change this later:
- AppHost is separate project, can be removed without affecting application code
- Each service should still be runnable independently
- Can migrate back to Docker Compose or other orchestration if needed

## Additional Considerations

### Not Addressed in This Decision

1. **Integration Testing**
   - Should we use Aspire for integration test orchestration?
   - Consider separate ADR if integration tests need distributed service setup

2. **CI/CD Impact**
   - GitHub Actions workflows currently build/test without Aspire
   - Evaluate if CI should use Aspire for more realistic testing

3. **Production Aspire Hosting**
   - Keep monitoring Aspire hosting maturity
   - Revisit deployment decision in 6 months
   - Consider Azure Container Apps + Aspire manifest deployment

4. **Local Development Alternatives**
   - Document fallback for developers who can't/won't use Aspire
   - Ensure services can run standalone with environment variables
