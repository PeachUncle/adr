# Define the order of steps when building a Drupal site

When updating Drupal code and configuration in a given environment, it's useful to make sure all members of the team and all teams follow a consistent set of steps, in the same order. Having consistent steps across multiple projects will reduce onboarding for new team members.

## Decision

We standardize the build steps as:

```sh
vendor/bin/drush cache:clear plugin -y
# Run numbered module updates (hook_update_N) only.
vendor/bin/drush updatedb --no-post-updates -y
# Run config:import twice to make sure we catch any config that didn't declare
# a dependency correctly. This is also useful when importing large config sets
# as it can sometimes hit an out of memory error.
vendor/bin/drush config:import -y || true
vendor/bin/drush config:import -y
# Run updatedb again for updates dependent on config changes
# This second run should fire all hook_post_update_NAME() hooks.
vendor/bin/drush updatedb --no-cache-clear -y
vendor/bin/drush cache:rebuild -y
```

Developers should write update hooks using these guidelines:

### [`HOOK_update_N()`](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal!Core!Extension!module.api.php/function/hook_update_N)

Code that does not rely on any Drupal APIs, usually to perform direct database
queries.

These hooks are the first ones to be executed, before configuration is imported.

### [`HOOK_post_update_NAME()`](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal!Core!Extension!module.api.php/function/hook_post_update_NAME)

These are called when Drupal is fully bootstrapped and all Drupal APIs are
safe to use.

Using the approach outlined above with two `drush updatedb` executions,
implementations of this hook will be executed _after_ configuration is imported,
so developers are able to rely on new config being available when it's executed.

`drush deploy:hook` is not used as discussed in [Evaluate integrating drush deploy:hook or patch in core to allow code execution after configuration is imported #32](https://github.com/Lullabot/drainpipe/issues/32).

## Consequences

- Developers have a clear and consistent guide to use update hooks among
  projects.
- Automation can be built to ensure these steps are executed consistently.
