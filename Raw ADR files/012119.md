# ADR-002: Synchronous Architecture Choice

## Status
**Accepted** - 2025-01-24

## Context
When implementing the Maven MCP Server, we needed to decide between an asynchronous (async/await) or synchronous architecture. This decision impacts performance characteristics, code complexity, and maintainability.

The FastMCP framework supports both patterns, and Maven Central API calls are I/O-bound operations that could benefit from async handling.

## Decision
Use **synchronous (non-async)** implementation for tools and services. Prompts and resources use async as required by FastMCP framework.

## Rationale
1. **Maven Operations are Sequential**: Most Maven operations follow a sequential pattern (check existence → fetch metadata → parse versions)
2. **Simplicity**: Synchronous code is easier to understand, debug, and maintain for core tool logic
3. **No Concurrency Requirements**: Individual tool calls don't benefit from async patterns
4. **Hybrid Architecture**: FastMCP requires async for prompts/resources but allows sync for tools
5. **Error Handling**: Synchronous error handling is more straightforward with try/catch blocks for business logic

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Full Async Implementation**
   - **Pros**: Better concurrency, non-blocking I/O, potential performance gains
   - **Cons**: Complex error handling, harder debugging, async/await throughout codebase
   - **Decision**: Rejected due to unnecessary complexity for our use case

2. **Hybrid Approach (Async for I/O)**
   - **Pros**: Performance benefits for network calls
   - **Cons**: Mixed paradigms, conversion overhead, complexity at boundaries
   - **Decision**: Rejected to maintain consistency

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Simpler codebase that's easier to understand
- Straightforward debugging with standard stack traces
- No async state management complexity
- Faster development time
- Standard exception handling patterns

**Negative:**
- Limited concurrent request handling in tools
- Potential blocking on slow Maven Central responses
- Hybrid codebase with both sync (tools) and async (prompts/resources) patterns
- Sequential processing of batch operations

**Note:** Prompts and Resources use async as required by FastMCP framework for proper state management and MCP protocol compliance.

## Implementation Example
```python
# Synchronous implementation (chosen)
def check_version(dependency: str, version: str) -> dict:
    try:
        # Direct, sequential calls
        exists = maven_api.check_version_exists(dependency, version)
        metadata = maven_api.get_metadata(dependency)
        latest = version_service.find_latest(metadata, version)
        return format_response(exists, latest)
    except Exception as e:
        return format_error(e)

# Async alternative (rejected)
async def check_version(dependency: str, version: str) -> dict:
    try:
        # Would require await throughout
        exists = await maven_api.check_version_exists(dependency, version)
        metadata = await maven_api.get_metadata(dependency)
        latest = await version_service.find_latest(metadata, version)
        return format_response(exists, latest)
    except Exception as e:
        return format_error(e)
```

## Success Criteria
- Response times remain under 2 seconds for typical operations
- Code remains maintainable and debuggable
- No concurrency-related bugs or issues
- Developer onboarding time stays minimal
