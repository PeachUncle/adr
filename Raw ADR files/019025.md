# ADR-001: Use FastAPI as Web Framework

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2023 (Initial project setup)

**Deciders:** Project team

---

## Context

We needed to choose a Python web framework for building a production-ready TODO API with the following requirements:

- Modern async/await support for high performance
- Automatic API documentation
- Strong data validation
- Type hints support
- Active community and maintenance
- Fast development iteration

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
   - Pros: Mature, batteries-included, large ecosystem, ORM
   - Cons: Synchronous by default, heavy for simple APIs, steeper learning curve

2. **Flask**
   - Pros: Lightweight, flexible, well-established
   - Cons: No built-in async, manual validation, no automatic docs

3. **FastAPI** ✅
   - Pros: Native async, automatic docs (Swagger/ReDoc), Pydantic validation, high performance, modern Python features
   - Cons: Younger ecosystem, less mature than Django/Flask

4. **Sanic**
   - Pros: Async, fast
   - Cons: Smaller community, less documentation tooling

---

## Decision

We chose **FastAPI** as our web framework.

### Rationale

1. **Performance**: Native async/await support crucial for I/O-bound operations (database queries)
2. **Type Safety**: Leverages Python type hints for validation and IDE support
3. **Automatic Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger docs generated automatically from code
4. **Pydantic Integration**: Built-in data validation using Pydantic models
5. **Modern Python**: Designed for Python 3.6+ with modern features
6. **Developer Experience**: Fast iteration, clear error messages, excellent documentation
7. **Community Momentum**: Rapidly growing adoption and ecosystem

### Key Features Used

- `@app.get`, `@app.post` decorators for routing
- Dependency injection for authentication
- Request/response models with Pydantic
- Automatic OpenAPI schema generation at `/docs`
- async/await for database operations
- Lifespan events for startup/shutdown

---

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Rapid Development**: Built-in features reduced boilerplate code
✅ **Type Safety**: Caught errors during development, not runtime
✅ **API Documentation**: Swagger UI automatically generated and always in sync
✅ **Performance**: Async operations handle concurrent requests efficiently
✅ **Validation**: Pydantic ensures data integrity without manual checks
✅ **Developer Onboarding**: Type hints and docs make code self-documenting

### Negative

⚠️ **Learning Curve**: Team needed to learn async patterns
⚠️ **Younger Ecosystem**: Fewer third-party integrations vs Django
⚠️ **Breaking Changes**: Framework evolving rapidly (though stable since 0.100)

### Neutral

- No ORM included (using pymongo directly - see ADR-002)
- No admin panel (not needed for API-only service)
- Requires Python 3.7+ (acceptable for new project)

---

## Follow-up Decisions

- **Pydantic v2 Migration** (ADR-003): Upgraded to leverage performance improvements
- **JWT Authentication** (ADR-004): Implemented using FastAPI's security utilities
- **Testing Strategy** (ADR-006): Chose pytest compatible with FastAPI's testclient
