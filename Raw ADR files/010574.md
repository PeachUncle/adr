# Decision: Content Truncation Strategy for Oracle-Student Consistency

**Date**: 2025-11-09
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Project team
**Context**: Ensuring oracle and student model see identical inputs during distillation

---

## Context

The LLM Distillery uses a two-stage distillation approach:
1. **Oracle labeling**: Cloud LLM (Gemini Flash) labels articles
2. **Student training**: Local 7B model (Qwen2.5) learns from oracle labels

For distillation to work, the student must see **exactly the same input** as the oracle during training. If oracle receives full 5,000-word articles but student trains on truncated versions, the learned mapping will be incorrect.

Additionally, very long articles create several problems:
- **API costs**: Gemini Flash pricing based on tokens (~$0.001/article but scales with length)
- **Speed**: Longer context = slower inference
- **Context limits**: Gemini Flash supports 1M input tokens, but processing is slower for large inputs
- **Training efficiency**: Qwen fine-tuning with very long sequences requires more VRAM

## Decision

**Implement smart content compression at ~800 words (≈3,000 tokens) for BOTH oracle and student**

This compression is applied in `ground_truth/batch_scorer.py`:

```python
def _smart_compress_content(self, content: str, max_words: int = 800) -> str:
    """
    Smart compression that preserves sentence boundaries and key paragraphs.
    
    Strategy:
    1. Split into paragraphs
    2. Take all paragraphs until word limit reached
    3. Break at sentence boundary if needed
    4. Preserve structure (no mid-sentence cuts)
    """
```

**Key principle**: Apply BEFORE oracle analysis, persist in labeled data, use same truncated version for training.

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ **Oracle-student consistency**: Both see identical input → distillation quality preserved
- ✅ **Cost reduction**: ~70% cost savings (typical article 2,500 words → 800 words)
- ✅ **Speed improvement**: Faster oracle labeling (~3 sec/article → ~2 sec/article)
- ✅ **Training efficiency**: Fits comfortably in Qwen's 32K context, lower VRAM usage
- ✅ **Quality preservation**: 800 words typically captures full article context for news pieces

### Negative
- ⚠️ **Information loss**: Long-form articles (5,000+ words) lose later content
- ⚠️ **Edge cases**: Very dense technical reports may need full text
- ⚠️ **Not configurable**: Currently hardcoded at 800 words per filter

### Neutral
- Compression is "smart" (sentence-boundary aware) not naive truncation
- Most news articles are 500-1,500 words → rarely hit limit
- Academic papers and reports DO hit limit but key info usually in abstract/intro

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. No Truncation (Full Articles)
**Pros**:
- No information loss
- Handles all content types

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Expensive**: 3-5x higher API costs
- ❌ **Slow**: Longer inference times
- ❌ **Training issues**: Very long sequences difficult to fine-tune efficiently
- ❌ **Diminishing returns**: Most semantic signals in first 800 words

**Verdict**: Cost and efficiency gains outweigh rare information loss

### 2. Adaptive Truncation (Per Article)
**Pros**:
- Could truncate more aggressively for short articles
- Could preserve more for dense content

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Complexity**: Need heuristics to determine "optimal" length per article
- ❌ **Inconsistency**: Variable-length inputs harder to batch efficiently
- ❌ **Marginal benefit**: Fixed 800 words works well in practice

**Verdict**: YAGNI - fixed limit is simpler and effective

### 3. Summarization Instead of Truncation
**Pros**:
- Could preserve key points from entire article
- More "intelligent" compression

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Expensive**: Requires LLM call BEFORE oracle analysis → 2x cost
- ❌ **Information distortion**: Summarization changes content, not just shortens
- ❌ **Oracle-student mismatch**: Oracle sees summary, student needs to learn from summaries → adds complexity

**Verdict**: Defeats purpose of preserving original content

### 4. Different Limits for Oracle vs Student
**Pros**:
- Could give oracle more context (e.g., 2,000 words)
- Student could train on shorter (e.g., 500 words)

**Cons**:
- ❌ **BREAKS DISTILLATION**: Violates core principle that oracle and student must see identical input
- ❌ **Incorrect learning**: Student learns mapping from shortened input that oracle never saw

**Verdict**: Fundamentally incompatible with distillation approach

## Implementation Details

### Location
- Primary: `ground_truth/batch_scorer.py:_smart_compress_content()`
- Also used in: NexusMind-Filter uplifting filter (6,000 char limit)

### Compression Algorithm
```python
1. Split content into paragraphs
2. Accumulate paragraphs while under word limit
3. If next paragraph exceeds limit:
   - Split into sentences
   - Add sentences until limit reached
   - Break at sentence boundary (never mid-sentence)
4. Return compressed content
```

### Configuration
Currently hardcoded:
- `max_words=800` (~3,000 tokens)
- Could be made configurable per filter in future if needed

### Training Data
Truncated content is:
- Stored in oracle-labeled JSONL files
- Used directly for training data preparation
- Same truncated version used for student fine-tuning

## Validation

**Tested on**:
- Tech deployment filter: 2,186 articles labeled with 800-word limit
- Distribution: 85% under limit naturally, 15% truncated
- Quality: Spot-check of 50 truncated articles showed no semantic loss for scoring

**Evidence**:
- News articles (majority of corpus): 500-1,500 words → rarely truncated
- Technical articles that ARE truncated: Key deployment info in first 800 words
- No observed degradation in oracle scoring quality
